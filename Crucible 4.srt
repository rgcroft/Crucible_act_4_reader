The Crucible Act 4 by Arthur Miller, Drama, Review and Inticipate

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,640
Is every defense in attack upon the court?

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,040
Hail asks in Act 3.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,800
Danforth observes

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,440
A person is either with this court or he must be counted against it.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,520
Such remarks stress the powerlessness of people like John Proctor and Giles Cori against

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,080
the mounting injustices in Salem.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,680
In pursuing justice, their efforts backfire and their own names join the list of those

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,000
accused.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,640
What do you think the final outcome will be?

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,160
Who will survive?

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,600
And who will perish?

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,880
Read the final act to see if your predictions are correct.

The Crucible Act 4 by Arthur Miller

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,400
Assel in Salem, jail, that fall.

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,640
With the back is a high-bard window, near it, a great heavy door, along the walls are two

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,320
benches.

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,200
The place is in darkness, but for the moonlight seeping through the bars, it appears empty,

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,520
presently, footsteps are heard coming down a corridor beyond the wall.

20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,280
Keys rattle, and the door swings open.

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,600
Marshall Herrick enters with a lantern.

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,400
He is nearly drunk, and heavy-footed.

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,160
He goes to a bench and nudges a bundle of rags lying on it.

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,800
Zara, wake up, Sarah Good.

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,400
He then crosses to the other benches.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,840
Sarah Good, rising in her rags.

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,640
Oh, majesty.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,400
Common, common, Titchu-but, he's here.

29
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,720
His majesty's come.

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,480
Dirty north-cells, places wanted now.

31
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,600
He hangs his lantern on the wall.

32
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,920
Titchu-but sits up.

33
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,840
That don't look to me like his majesty.

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,560
Look to me like the Marshall.

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,800
Herrick, taking out a flask.

36
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Get along with you now.

37
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,960
Clear this place.

38
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,080
He drinks, and Sarah Good comes, and pears up into his face.

39
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,840
Oh, is it you, Marshall?

40
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,240
I thought sure you'd be the devil common for us.

41
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,960
Could I have a sip of cider from a going away?

42
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,280
Herrick, handing her the flask.

43
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,880
And we off to Sarah, Titchu-but, and Sarah drinks.

44
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,920
We go into Barbados, soon the devil gets here with the feathers and the wings.

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,320
Oh, I happy voyage to you.

46
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,640
A pair of blueprints, winging suddenly the two of us.

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,320
Oh, it'd be a grand transformation, Marshall.

48
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,960
She raises the flask to drink again.

49
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,560
Herrick, taking the flask from her lips.

50
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,880
Get better give me that, or you'll never rise off the ground.

51
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,400
Come along now.

52
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,880
I'll speak to him for you if you desire to come along, Marshall.

53
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,920
Wait, Nat refuse it, Titchu-but?

54
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,880
It's the proper morning to fly into hell.

55
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,800
Oh, it'd be no hell in Barbados.

56
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,080
Devil, him be pleasure-man in Barbados, him be singing and dancing in Barbados.

57
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,840
It's you, folks.

58
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,960
You riles him up around here.

59
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,080
It'd be too cold around here for that old boy.

60
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,240
He frees his soul in Massachusetts, but in Barbados he just as sweet and…

61
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,600
A bellowing cow is heard, and Titchu-but leaps up and calls to the window.

62
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,960
I, sir.

63
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,240
That's him, Sarah.

64
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,480
I'm here, Majesty.

65
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,320
They heardly pick up the rags as Hopkins, a guard enters.

66
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,480
That that'd be the governor's arrived.

67
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,480
Herrick, grabbing Titchu-but.

68
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480
Come along.

69
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,880
Come along.

70
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,480
Titchu-but resisting him.

71
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,720
No, he coming for me.

72
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
I go at home.

73
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,320
Herrick, pulling her to the door.

74
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,920
That's not Satan, just a poor old cow with a head full of milk.

75
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
Come along now.

76
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Out with you.

77
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,200
Titchu-but calling to the window.

78
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,680
Take me home, Devil.

79
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,920
Take me home.

80
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,760
Sarah good, following the shouting Titchu-but out.

81
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,680
Tell him I'm going, Titchu-but.

82
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,320
Now you tell him Sarah good is going to.

83
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,400
In the corridor outside, Titchu-but calls on.

84
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,200
Take me home, Devil.

85
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,240
Devil take me home.

86
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,040
And Hopkins' voice orders her to move on.

87
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,680
Herrick returns and begins to push old rags and straw into a corner.

88
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,400
Hearing footsteps, he turns, and enter, Danforth, and judge, Hathorn.

89
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,880
They are in great coats and where hats against the bitter cold.

90
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,720
They are followed in by chiever, who carries a dispatch case and a flat wooden box containing his

91
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,360
writing materials.

92
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,200
Good morning, Excellency.

93
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,640
Where is Mr. Paris?

94
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
Elfitu.

95
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,240
He starts for the door.

96
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Marshall?

97
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
Herrick stops.

98
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,280
When did Revere hail arrive?

99
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,800
Withward midnight, I think.

100
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,040
Danforth, suspiciously.

101
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,280
What is he about here?

102
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,000
He goes among them that will hang sur and he prays with them.

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,520
He sits with goodie nurse now and is to Paris with them.

104
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,520
Indeed.

105
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,840
That ban have no authority to enter here, Marshall.

106
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,560
Why he will let him in.

107
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,560
What?

108
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,920
Mr. Paris command, Mr. I can not deny him.

109
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,520
Are you drunk, Marshall?

110
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,520
No, sir.

111
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,240
It is a bitter night and I have no fire here.

112
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,760
Danforth, containing his anger.

113
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,760
Fetch, Mr. Paris.

114
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,200
There is a prestigious stench in this place.

115
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,240
I have only not cleared the people out for you.

116
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,840
Beware, hard, drink, Marshall.

117
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,200
Nice, sir.

118
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,560
He waits in instant for further orders, but Danforth, in dissatisfaction, turns his back on

119
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
him.

120
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,120
And Herrick goes out.

121
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,560
There is a pause.

122
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,120
Danforth stands in thought.

123
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,560
Let you question hail, Excellency.

124
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,960
I should not be surprised he have been preaching in and over lately.

125
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,200
He will come to that speak nothing of Andover.

126
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,640
Paris praises with him.

127
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,800
That strange.

128
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,200
He blows on his hands.

129
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,600
Moves toward the window.

130
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
It looks out.

131
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,480
Excellency, I wonder if it be wise to let Mr. Paris so continuously with the prisoners.

132
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,080
Danforth turns to him.

133
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Interested.

134
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,960
I think sometimes the man has a man look these days.

135
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
Mad?

136
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,920
I met him yesterday coming out of his house and I beat him good morning and he wept and went

137
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,560
his way.

138
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,600
I think it is not well the village sees him so unsteady.

139
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,360
Perhaps he have some sorrow.

140
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,960
Cheever, stepping his feet against the cold.

141
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,320
I think it be the cause, sir.

142
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Cows?

143
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,240
There be so many cows wandering the high roads.

144
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,560
Now their masters are in the jails and much disagreement who they will belong to now.

145
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,880
I know Mr. Paris be arguing with farmers all yesterday.

146
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,040
There is great contention, sir, about the cows.

147
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,000
Contention making weeps, sir.

148
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,600
There is always a man that weep for contention.

149
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,960
He turns as to have thorn and Danforth hearing someone coming up the corridor.

150
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,800
Danforth raises his head as Paris enters.

151
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,520
He is gone, frightened and sweating in his great coat.

152
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,400
Paris to Danforth instantly.

153
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,680
Oh good morning, sir.

154
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
Thank you for coming.

155
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,680
I beg your pardon waking you so early.

156
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,480
Good morning, Judge Hathorn.

157
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,720
Have you ever in hell have no right to enter this?

158
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,240
Excellency am moment.

159
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,560
He hurries back and shuts the door.

160
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,040
Do you leave him alone with the prisoners?

161
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,960
What is business here?

162
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,800
Paris, prayerfully holding up his hands.

163
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,400
Excellency hear me.

164
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,360
It is a Providence Reverend Hale has returned to bring Rebecca nurse to God.

165
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,240
Danforth, surprised.

166
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
He bits her confess.

167
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,800
Paris, sitting.

168
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,240
Hear me.

169
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,280
Rebecca have not given me a word this three month since she came.

170
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,600
Now she sits with him and her sister and Martha Cory and two or three others and he pleads

171
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
with them.

172
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,560
Confess their crimes and save their lives.

173
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Why?

174
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,840
This is indeed a Providence.

175
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,720
And they soften, they soften?

176
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,000
Not yet, not yet.

177
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,640
But I thought to summon you, sir, that we might think on whether it be not wise to.

178
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,200
He dares not say it.

179
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,320
I had thought to put a question, sir, and I hope you will not.

180
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,040
Mr. Paris, be plain but troubles you.

181
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,920
There is news, sir, that the court must reckon with.

182
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,280
Mind, niece, sir, mind.

183
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,960
I believe she has vanished.

184
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Vanished?

185
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,080
I had thought to advise you about earlier in the week, but.

186
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,280
Why?

187
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,840
How long has she gone?

188
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,800
This be the third night.

189
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,640
You see, sir, she told me she would stay in night with Mercy Lewis.

190
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,840
And next day, when she does not return, I send to Mr. Lewis to inquire.

191
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,160
Mercy told him she would sleep in my house for a night.

192
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,640
They are both gone?

193
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,280
Paris in fear of him.

194
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,880
They are, sir.

195
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,440
Danforth, alarmed.

196
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,320
I will send a party for them.

197
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,120
Where may they be?

198
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,360
Excellency, I think they be aboard a ship.

199
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,200
And forth, stands a game.

200
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,880
My daughter tells me how she heard them speaking of ships last week.

201
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,160
And tonight I discover my, my strong boxes broken to.

202
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,960
He presses his fingers against his eyes to keep back tears.

203
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,680
Half-orn, astonished.

204
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,640
She helped robbed you.

205
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,440
31 pound is gone.

206
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,840
I am penniless.

207
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,400
He covers his face and sobs.

208
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,760
Mr. Paris, you are a brainless man.

209
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,040
He walks and thought deeply worried.

210
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,480
Excellency, it profit nothing you should blame me.

211
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,000
I cannot think they would run off except they fear to keep in seal them anymore.

212
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,320
He is pleading.

213
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Markets, sir.

214
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,120
Abigail had close knowledge of the town and since the news of Andover has broken here.

215
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,280
Andover is remedied.

216
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,640
The court returns there on Friday and will resume examinations.

217
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,760
I am sure of it, sir.

218
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,800
But the rumor here speaks rebellion in Andover.

219
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,320
And it, there is no rebellion in Andover.

220
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,320
I tell you what is said, sir.

221
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,480
Andover have thrown out the court, they say, and will have no part of witchcraft.

222
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,080
There be a faction here feeding on that news and I tell you, tru, sir.

223
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,800
I fear there will be right here.

224
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Right?

225
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,080
Why at every execution I have seen not but high set of spaction in the town.

226
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,000
Just, half-orn, it were another sort that hang till now.

227
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,360
Rebecca Nurse is no bridge that lived three years with Bishop before she married him.

228
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,280
John Proctor is not Isaac Ward that drank his family to ruin.

229
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,280
To Danforth.

230
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,520
I would, to God, it would not so, excellency.

231
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,760
But these people have great weight yet in the town.

232
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,680
Let Rebecca stand upon the gibbet and send up some righteous prayer and I fear shall

233
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,960
wake avenge on you.

234
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Excellent, see.

235
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,600
She is condemned a witch.

236
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,800
The court have...

237
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,400
Danforth, indeed concerned, raising a hand to half-orn.

238
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,120
Pray, or to Paris.

239
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
How do you propose, then?

240
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
Excellency.

241
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,480
I would postpone these hangings for a time.

242
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,120
There will be no postponement.

243
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,880
Now, Mr. Hales returned.

244
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:14,360
There is hope, I think, for if he bring even one of these to God that confession surely

245
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,000
dams the others in the public eye.

246
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,120
And none may doubt more that they are all linked to hell.

247
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,560
This way, unconfessed and claiming innocence, doubts are multiplied.

248
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,880
Many honest people will wait for them and our good purpose is lost in their tears.

249
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,800
Danforth, after thinking a moment, then going to cheever.

250
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,520
Give me the list.

251
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,560
Cheever opens the dispatch case.

252
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Searches.

253
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,120
It cannot be for God's sir that when I summon the congregation for John Proctor's excommunication,

254
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,160
there were hardly thirty people come to hear it that speak a discontent, I think, and

255
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,600
Danforth studying the list, there will be no postponement.

256
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Excellency.

257
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,160
Now, sir.

258
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,000
Which of these, in your opinion, may be brought to God.

259
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,400
I will, myself, strive with him till dawn.

260
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,760
He hands the list to Paris, who merely glances at him.

261
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,160
"There is not sufficient time till dawn.

262
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,640
I shall do my utmost.

263
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,720
Which of them do you have hope for?

264
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
Paris.

265
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,560
Not even glancing at the list now.

266
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,560
And in a quavering voice quietly.

267
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,560
Excellency.

268
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,560
A dagger.

269
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,560
He chokes up.

270
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,560
What do you say?

271
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:33,560
Tonight, when I open my door to leave my house, a dagger clatter to the ground.

272
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,560
Silence.

273
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,560
Danforth absorbs this.

274
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
Now Paris cries out.

275
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,560
You cannot hang this sword.

276
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,560
There is danger for me.

277
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
I did not step outside at night.

278
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,560
Reverend Hale enters.

279
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,560
They look at him for an instant in silence.

280
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,560
He is steeped in sorrow, exhausted.

281
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
And more direct than he ever was.

282
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,560
Except my congratulations, Reverend Hale.

283
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,560
We are gladden to see you return to your good work.

284
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
Hale, coming to Danforth now.

285
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,560
You must pardon them.

286
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,560
They will not butch.

287
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
Haryc enters.

288
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,560
Wades.

289
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
Danforth, conciliatory.

290
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
You must understand, sir.

291
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,560
I cannot pardon these when twelve are already hanged for the same crime.

292
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,560
It is not just Paris, with failing heart.

293
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,560
Rebecca will not confess.

294
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,560
The sun will rise in a few minutes.

295
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Excellency, I must have more time.

296
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,560
Now Hale and begari yourselves no more.

297
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,560
I will not receive a single plea for pardon or postponement.

298
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,560
Then that will not confess will hang.

299
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,560
Twelve are already executed.

300
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,560
The names of these seven are given out, and the village expects to see them die this morning.

301
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,560
Postpoment, I'll speak a floundering on my part.

302
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,560
Reprieve or pardon must cast out upon the guilt of them that died till now.

303
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,560
While I speak God's law, I will not crack its voice with whimpering.

304
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,560
If retaliation is your fear, know this.

305
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:08,560
I should hang ten thousand that dared to rise against the law, and an ocean of salt tears could not melt the resolution of the statutes.

306
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,560
Now, joyous cells up like men, and help me.

307
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,560
As you are bound by heaven to do, have you spoken with them all Mr. Hale?

308
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,560
All but proctor, he is in the dungeon.

309
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,560
Danforth, to heric.

310
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,560
What's proctor's way now?

311
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:31,560
He sits like some great bird, who'd not know he lived except he will take food from time to time.

312
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Danforth, after thinking a moment.

313
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,560
His wife, his wife must be well on with child now.

314
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:46,560
Gee, sir, what thank you Mr. Paris, you have closer knowledge of this man, might her presence soften him?

315
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,560
It is possible, sir. He have not laid eyes on her these three months.

316
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,560
I should summon her.

317
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,560
Danforth, to heric.

318
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
Is he yet adamant?

319
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
Has he struck at you again?

320
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,560
He cannot, sir. He is jamed of the wall now.

321
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,560
Danforth, after thinking on it.

322
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,560
Fetch, could he proctor to me?

323
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,560
Then that you bring him up?

324
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,560
I sir.

325
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,560
Heric goes, there is silence.

326
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:19,560
Excellency, if you postpone a week and publish to the town that you are striving for their confessions,

327
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,560
that speak mercy on your part, not faltering.

328
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:33,560
Mr. Hale, is God have not empowered me like Joshua to stop this son from rising, so I cannot withhold from them the perfection of their punishment.

329
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,560
Hale, pardon me.

330
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:41,560
If you think God wills you to raise rebellion, Mr. Danforth, you are mistaken.

331
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,560
Danforth, instantly.

332
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,560
You have heard rebellion spoken in the town?

333
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:58,560
Excellency, there are orphans wandering from house to house, abandoned cattle, bellow on the high roads, the stink of rotting crops, hangs everywhere, and no man knows when the harlot's cry will end his life.

334
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,560
And you want to yet, if rebellion spoke, better you should marvel how they do not burn your province.

335
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,560
Mr. Hale, have you preached an end over this month?

336
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,560
Think God they have no need of me and an over.

337
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,560
You bath will me, sir. Why have you returned here?

338
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,560
Why? It is all simple.

339
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:25,560
I come to do the devil's work. I come to counsel Christians. They should belive themselves.

340
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,560
His sarcasm collapses.

341
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,560
There is blood on my head. Can you not see the blood on my head?

342
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,560
Hush, for he has heard footsteps. They all face the door.

343
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:46,560
Hale enters with a lizabeth. Her wrists are linked by heavy chain, which heric now removes. Her clothes are dirty. Her face is pale and gone. Herocos out.

344
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,560
Danforth, very politely.

345
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,560
Goodie, proctor, she is silent.

346
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,560
I hope you are hearty. Elizabeth, as a warning reminder.

347
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,560
I am yet six months before my time.

348
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:05,560
Frank, be at your ease. We come not for your life. We uncertain how to plead for he is not accustomed to it.

349
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,560
Mr. Hale, you speak with the woman?

350
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,560
Goodie proctor. Your husband is marked to hang this morning. Pause.

351
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
Elizabeth, quietly.

352
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,560
I have heard it.

353
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:21,560
You know, do you not have no connection with the court? She seems to doubt it.

354
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:31,560
I come of my own goodie proctor. I would save your husband's life for if he is taken, I count myself his murderer. Do you understand me?

355
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,560
What do you want of me?

356
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:44,560
Goodie proctor. I have gone this three month like I lored into the wilderness. I have sought a Christian way for damn nations doubled on a minister who counsels been to lie.

357
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,560
It is no lie, you cannot speak of lies.

358
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,560
It is a lie. They are innocent.

359
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,560
I'll hear no more of that.

360
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,560
Hale, continuing to Elizabeth.

361
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,560
Let you not mistake your duty as I mistook my own.

362
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:04,560
I came into this village like a bridegroom to his beloved bearing gifts of high religion.

363
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,560
The very crowns of holy law I brought and what I touched with my bright confidence.

364
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,560
It died. And where I turned the eye of my great faith, blood flowed up.

365
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:20,560
Beware, goodie proctor, cleave to no faith when faith brings blood.

366
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,560
It is mistaken law that leads you to sacrifice.

367
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,560
Life, woman, life is God's most precious gift.

368
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,560
No principle, however glorious, may justify the taking of it.

369
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,560
I beg you, woman, prevail upon your husband to confess.

370
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,560
Let him give his lie.

371
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,560
Quail not before God's judgment in this.

372
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:48,560
Fort may well be God, dams a liar less than he that throws his life away for pride.

373
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,560
Will you plead with him?

374
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,560
I cannot think you will listen to another.

375
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,560
Elizabeth, quietly.

376
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,560
I think that be the devil's argument.

377
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,560
Hale, with a climactic desperation.

378
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:07,560
Woman, before the laws of God we are a swine, we cannot read his will.

379
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,560
I cannot dispute with you, sir. I lack learning for it.

380
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,560
Danforth, going to her.

381
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,560
Goodie proctor, you are not summoned here for disputation.

382
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,560
Be there no wife the tenderness within you?

383
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,560
He will die with the sunrise, your husband, do you understand it?

384
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,560
She only looks at him.

385
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,560
What say you? Where you contend with him?

386
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,560
She is silent. Are you stoned?

387
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:43,560
I tell you true woman, had I know other proof of your unnatural life, your dry eyes now would be sufficient evidence that you delivered up your soul to hell.

388
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,560
A very ape would weep at such calamity.

389
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,560
Have the devil dried up any tear of pity in you?

390
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,560
She is silent.

391
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,560
Take her out. It profit nothing she should speak to him.

392
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,560
Elizabeth, quietly.

393
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,560
Let me speak with him, excellency.

394
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,560
Paris, with hope. You'll strive with him?

395
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
She hesitates.

396
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,560
Will you plead for his confession or will you not?

397
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,560
I promise nothing. Let me speak with him.

398
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,560
A sound, the civilins of dragging feet on stone. They turn.

399
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
A pause.

400
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Heric enters with John Proctor.

401
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,560
His wrists are chained. He is another man.

402
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,560
Bearded. Filthy. His eyes misty.

403
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,560
As the webs head overgrown them. He halts inside the doorway.

404
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,560
His eyes caught by the sight of Elizabeth.

405
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,560
The emotion flowing between them prevents anyone from speaking for an instant.

406
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,560
Now hail.

407
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,560
Visibly affected. Goes to Danforth and speaks quietly.

408
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,560
Pray. Leave the mexuncy.

409
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,560
Danforth. Pressing hail impatiently aside.

410
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,560
Mr. Proctor. You have been notified. Have you not?

411
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Proctor is silent. Staring at Elizabeth.

412
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,560
I see light in the sky, Mr.

413
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Let you come so with your wife and may God help you turn your back on hail.

414
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,560
Proctor is silent. Staring at Elizabeth.

415
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,560
Hail. Quietly. Excellency. Let.

416
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Danforth brushes past hail and walks out.

417
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,560
Hail follows. Chiever stands and follows.

418
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,560
Hathorn behind. Heric goes. Paris. From a safe distance offers.

419
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,560
If you desire a cup of cider, Mr. Proctor, I'm sure I.

420
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,560
Proctor turns an icy stare at him and he breaks off.

421
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Paris raises his palms toward Proctor.

422
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,560
God lead you now. Paris goes out.

423
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,560
Alone, Proctor walks to her. Halt's.

424
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,560
It is as though they stood in a spinning world.

425
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,560
It is beyond sorrow. Above it. He reaches out his hand as though toward an embodiment.

426
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Not quite real. An icy touches her. A strange soft sound. Half laughter.

427
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Half amazement. Comes from his throat. He pats her hand.

428
00:21:53,560 --> 00:22:00,560
She covers his hand with hers. And then weak. He sits. Then she sits. Facing him.

429
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:06,560
The child. It grows. There's no word of the boys.

430
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,560
They're well. Rebecca's Samuel keeps them.

431
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,560
You have not seen them? I have not. She catches a weakening in herself and downs it.

432
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:21,560
You are a marvellous Elizabeth. You have been tortured?

433
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,560
I. Pause. She will not let herself be drowned in the sea that threatens her.

434
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:33,560
They come for my life now. I know it. Pause. None. Have you had confessed?

435
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,560
There are many confessed. Who are they?

436
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:44,560
There are hundreds or more. They say. Goody ballad is one. I say a good kind is one.

437
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:50,560
There are many. Rebecca? Not Rebecca. She is one foot in heaven now.

438
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,560
Not may hurt her more. And child?

439
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,560
You have not heard of it? I hear nothing where I'm kept.

440
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:06,560
Child is dead. He looks at her incredulously. When where he hanged, Elizabeth quietly, factually.

441
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,560
He will not hanged. He would not answer I or nay to his indictment.

442
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,560
For if he denied the charge they'd hang him surely and auction out his property.

443
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:22,560
So he stand mute and died Christian under the law. And so his sons will have his farm.

444
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:29,560
It is the law for he could not be condemned a wizard without he answer the indictment. I or nay.

445
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:35,560
Then how does he die? Elizabeth, gently. They press him, John.

446
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,560
Press?

447
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:42,560
Great stones they lay upon his chest until he plead I or nay.

448
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:47,560
With a tender smile for the old man. They say he give them but two words.

449
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,560
More wait he says and died.

450
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:55,560
Proctor, numbed, a thread to weave into his agony.

451
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,560
More wait.

452
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,560
I, it wore a fearsome man, Giles Cory.

453
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,560
Pause.

454
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,560
Proctor with great force of will but not quite looking at her.

455
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:12,560
I have been thinking I would confess to them Elizabeth. She shows nothing.

456
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,560
What say you? If I give them that?

457
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,560
I cannot judge you, John.

458
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,560
Pause.

459
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,560
Proctor, simply a peer question. What would you have me do?

460
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,560
As you will I would have it.

461
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,560
Slight pause.

462
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,560
I want you living, John. That's sure.

463
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,560
Proctor, pauses. Then with a flailing of hope.

464
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,560
Child's wife, has she confessed?

465
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
She will not.

466
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
Pause.

467
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,560
It is a pretence Elizabeth.

468
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
What is?

469
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,560
I cannot mount the chip at like a saint. It is a fraud.

470
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,560
I am not that man. She is silent.

471
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,560
My honesty is broke Elizabeth.

472
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,560
I am no good man.

473
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:58,560
Nothing spoiled by giving them this lie that were not rotten long before.

474
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,560
And yet you have not confessed till now that speak goodness in you.

475
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,560
Spide only keeps me silent.

476
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,560
This is hard to give a lie to dogs.

477
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,560
Pause.

478
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,560
For the first time he turns directly to her.

479
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,560
I would have your forgiveness Elizabeth.

480
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,560
It is not for me to give, John. I am.

481
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,560
I'd have you see some honesty in it. Let them that never lie,

482
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,560
die now to keep their souls. It is pretence for me.

483
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,560
A vanity that will not blind God nor keep my children out of the wind.

484
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,560
Pause.

485
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
What's a you?

486
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,560
Elizabeth, upon a heaving sigh that always threatens.

487
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,560
John, it come to not that I should forgive you. If you will not forgive yourself.

488
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,560
Now he turns away a little in great agony.

489
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,560
It is not my soul, John. It is yours.

490
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:54,560
He stands as though in physical pain slowly rising to his feet with a great immortal longing

491
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,560
to find his answer. It is difficult to say as she is on the verge of tears.

492
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Only be sure of this for I know it now.

493
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,560
Whatever you will do, it is a good man does it.

494
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,560
He turns his doubting, searching gaze upon her.

495
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,560
I have read my heart this three month, John.

496
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,560
Pause.

497
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,560
I have sins of my own to count. It needs a cold wife to prompt literary.

498
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
Proctor and great pain.

499
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,560
Enough and enough.

500
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,560
Elizabeth, now pouring out her heart.

501
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,560
Better you should know me.

502
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,560
I will not hear it. I know you.

503
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,560
You take my sins upon you, John.

504
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,560
Proctor and agony.

505
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,560
No. I take my own, my own.

506
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
John.

507
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:45,560
I counted myself so plain, so poorly made, no honest love could come to me.

508
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Suspicion kissed you when I did.

509
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:53,560
I never knew how I should say my love. It were a cold house I kept.

510
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,560
In fright, she swears as half-orn enters.

511
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,560
What say a proctor? The sun is suit-up.

512
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,560
Proctor is chest-heaving, stairs.

513
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Turns to Elizabeth. She comes to him as though to plead, or voice-quaking.

514
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,560
Do what you will, but let none be your judge.

515
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,560
There be no higher judge under heaven than Proctor is.

516
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,560
Forgive me for give me, John. I never knew such goodness in the world.

517
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,560
She covers her face, weeping.

518
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,560
Proctor turns from her to Hathorn. He is off the earth.

519
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,560
His voice, hollow.

520
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
I want my life.

521
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,560
Hathorn electrified, surprised.

522
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,560
You'll confess yourself?

523
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,560
I will have my life.

524
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,560
Hathorn, with a mystical tone.

525
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,560
God be praised. It is a providence. He rushes out the door,

526
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,560
and his voice is heard calling down the corridor.

527
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,560
He will confess. Proctor will confess.

528
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,560
Proctor with a cry as he strives to the door.

529
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,560
Why do you cry it?

530
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,560
And great pain, he turns back to her.

531
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,560
It is evil, is it not?

532
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,560
It is evil.

533
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,560
Elizabeth, in terror, weeping.

534
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,560
I cannot judge you, John. I cannot.

535
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,560
Then who will judge me?

536
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,560
Suddenly clasping his hands.

537
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,560
God in heaven.

538
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,560
What is John Proctor?

539
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,560
What is John Proctor?

540
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,560
He moves as an animal, and the fury is writing in him.

541
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,560
Attentaly is to search. I think it is honest, I think so.

542
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,560
I am no saint.

543
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,560
As though she had denied this, he calls angerly at her.

544
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,560
Let Rebecca go like a saint.

545
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,560
For me, it is fraud.

546
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,560
Voices are heard in the hall, speaking together in surprised excitement.

547
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,560
I am not your judge. I cannot be.

548
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,560
As though giving him release.

549
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,560
Do as you will. Do as you will.

550
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,560
Would you give them such a lie?

551
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,560
Say it.

552
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,560
Would you ever give them this?

553
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,560
She cannot answer.

554
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,560
You would not.

555
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,560
It tongs of fire, or singing you, you would not.

556
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,560
It is evil.

557
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,560
Good then. It is evil, and I do it.

558
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,560
How Thorn enters with Danforth, and with them,

559
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,560
Cheever, Paris, and Hail.

560
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,560
It is a business like rapid entrance, as though the ice had been broken.

561
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:13,560
Danforth, with great relief and gratitude.

562
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,560
Praise to God, man.

563
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,560
Praise to God.

564
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,560
You shall be blessed and heaven for this.

565
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,560
Cheever has hurried to the bench with pen, ink, and paper.

566
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,560
Proctor watches him.

567
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Now then, let us have it. Are you ready, Mr. Cheever?

568
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Proctor with a cold, cold, horror at their efficiency.

569
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,560
Why must it be written?

570
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,560
My for the good instruction of the village, Mr.

571
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,560
This we shall post upon the church door.

572
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,560
To Paris urgently.

573
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,560
Where's the marshal?

574
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,560
Paris runs to the door and calls down the corridor.

575
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,560
Marshall, hurry.

576
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:51,560
Now then, Mr. We'll you speak slowly and directly to the point for Mr. Cheever's sake.

577
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,560
He is unrecognized and is really dictating to Cheever, who writes.

578
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,560
Mr. Proctor, have you seen the devil in your life?

579
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,560
Proctor's jaws lock.

580
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,560
Come, man. There is light in the sky that Hound waits at the scaffold.

581
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,560
I would give out this news.

582
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,560
Did you see the devil?

583
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
I did.

584
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
Praise God.

585
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,560
And when he come to you, what were his demand?

586
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Proctor is silent.

587
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
Danforth helps.

588
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,560
Did he bid you to do his work upon the earth?

589
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,560
He did.

590
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,560
And you bound yourself to his service?

591
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:32,560
Danforth turns as Rebecca nurse enters with her helping to support her.

592
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,560
She is barely able to walk.

593
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Come in, come in, woman.

594
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,560
Rebecca, brightening as she sees Proctor.

595
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,560
Ah, John. You are well, then, eh?

596
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,560
Proctor turns as face to the wall.

597
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,560
Courage, man. Courage.

598
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,560
That her witness your good example that she may come to God herself.

599
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,560
Now, here at Goode University.

600
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,560
Say, "On the projector, did you bind yourself to the devil's service?"

601
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Rebecca astonished.

602
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
Why, John?

603
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,560
Proctor, through his teeth, his face turned from Rebecca.

604
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
I did.

605
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:11,560
Now, woman, you surely see it, profit nothing to keep this conspiracy, any further.

606
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,560
Will you confess yourself with him?

607
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,560
Oh, John.

608
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,560
God sent his mercy on you.

609
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,560
I say, will you confess yourself, Goode nurse?

610
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,560
Why?

611
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
It is a lie.

612
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,560
It is a lie.

613
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,560
How may I damn myself?

614
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,560
I cannot.

615
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,560
I cannot.

616
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:34,560
Mr. Proctor, with the devil came to you, did you see Rebecca nurse in his company?

617
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,560
Proctor is silent.

618
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,560
Come, man, take courage.

619
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,560
Did you ever see her with the devil?

620
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Proctor, almost inaudibly.

621
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,560
No.

622
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Danforth, now sensing trouble, glances at John and goes to the table.

623
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,560
It picks up a sheet.

624
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
The list of condemned.

625
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Did you ever see her sister, Mary Easty with the devil?

626
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,560
No, I did not.

627
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,560
Danforth, his eyes narrow and proctor.

628
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,560
Did you ever see Martha Corrie with the devil?

629
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
I did not.

630
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,560
Danforth, realizing slowly putting a sheet down.

631
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,560
Did you ever see anyone with the devil?

632
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,560
I did not.

633
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,560
Proctor, you must take me.

634
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:16,560
I am not empowered to trade your life for a lie.

635
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,560
You have most certainly seen some person with the devil?

636
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
Proctor is silent.

637
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,560
Mr. Proctor, a score of people have already testified.

638
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,560
They saw this woman with the devil.

639
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,560
Then it is proved.

640
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,560
Why must I say it?

641
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,560
Why must you say it?

642
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,560
Why you should rejoice to say it if your soul is truly perished of any love for help?

643
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,560
They think to go like saints.

644
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,560
I like not to spoil their names.

645
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,560
Danforth, inquiring.

646
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:50,560
Proctor, do you think they go like saints?

647
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,560
Proctor, evading.

648
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,560
This woman never thought she'd done the devil's work.

649
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Look, you sir.

650
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,560
I think you must take your duty here.

651
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,560
It matter nothing what she thought.

652
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:07,560
She is convicted of the unnatural murder of children and you for sending your spirit out upon Mary Warren.

653
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,560
Your soul alone is the issue here, Mr.

654
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:15,560
And you will prove it's whiteness, or you cannot live in a Christian country.

655
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:20,560
Will you tell me now what persons conspired with you in the devil's company?

656
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,560
Proctor is silent.

657
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,560
To your knowledge was Rebecca Nurse, ever.

658
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,560
I speak by own sins.

659
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,560
I cannot judge another.

660
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,560
Crying out with hatred.

661
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,560
I have no tongue for it.

662
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,560
Hail quickly to Danforth.

663
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,560
Excellency, it is enough.

664
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,560
He confess himself.

665
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,560
Let him sign it.

666
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Let him sign it.

667
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Paras, feverishly.

668
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
It is a great service sir.

669
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
It is a waiting name.

670
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,560
It will strike the village that Proctor confess.

671
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,560
I beg you.

672
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Let him sign it.

673
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
The sun is up.

674
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
Excellency.

675
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
Danforth.

676
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
Consitters.

677
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,560
Then with dissatisfaction.

678
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
Come, then.

679
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,560
Sign your testimony.

680
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,560
To cheever.

681
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
Give it to him.

682
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,560
Cheever goes to Proctor.

683
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,560
The confession and a pen in hand.

684
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,560
Proctor does not look at it.

685
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,560
Come, man.

686
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Sign it.

687
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,560
Proctor after glancing at the confession.

688
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
You have all witnessed it.

689
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,560
It is enough.

690
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,560
You will not sign it.

691
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,560
You have all witnessed it.

692
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
What more is needed.

693
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
Do you spot with me?

694
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,560
You will sign your name.

695
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,560
Or it is no confession, Mr.

696
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,560
He has pressed heeding with agonized breathing.

697
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,560
Proctor now lays the paper down and signs his name.

698
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,560
Praise be to the Lord.

699
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,560
Proctor has just finished signing when Danforth reaches for the paper.

700
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,560
But Proctor snatches it up.

701
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:43,560
And now a wild terror is rising in him and a boundless anger.

702
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,560
Danforth, perplexed, but politely extending his hand.

703
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,560
If you please, sir.

704
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,560
No.

705
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,560
Danforth, as though Proctor did not understand,

706
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,560
Mr. Proctor, I must have...

707
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,560
No.

708
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,560
No, I have signed it.

709
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,560
You have seen me.

710
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,560
It is done.

711
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,560
You have no need for this.

712
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:05,560
Proctor, the village must have proof that...

713
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,560
Damn the village.

714
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,560
I confess to God and God has seen my name on this.

715
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,560
It is enough.

716
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,560
No, sir.

717
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,560
It is.

718
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,560
You came to save my soul.

719
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,560
Did you not hear?

720
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,560
I have confessed myself.

721
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,560
It is enough.

722
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,560
You have not confessed myself.

723
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,560
Is there no good penitence, but it be public?

724
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,560
God does not lead my name nailed upon the church.

725
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,560
God sees my name.

726
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,560
God knows how black my sins are.

727
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
It is enough.

728
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,560
Mr. Proctor, you will not use me.

729
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,560
I am no serer, good or ticuba.

730
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,560
I am John Proctor.

731
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,560
You will not use me.

732
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,560
It is no part of salvation that you should use me.

733
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,560
I do not wish to.

734
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,560
I have three children.

735
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,560
How am I teach them to walk like men in the world?

736
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,560
And I sold my friends?

737
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,560
You have not sold your friends.

738
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,560
Be guide me not.

739
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:07,560
I blacken all of them when this is nailed to the church the very day they hang for silence.

740
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:13,560
Mr. Proctor, I must have good and legal proof that you are the high court.

741
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,560
Your word is good enough.

742
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,560
Tell them I confessed myself.

743
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:21,560
Say Proctor broke his knees and we have like a woman.

744
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
Say what you will.

745
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,560
But my name cannot.

746
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,560
Danforth with suspicion.

747
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,560
It is the same is it not?

748
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,560
If I report it or you sign to it?

749
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Proctor, he knows it is not saying.

750
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,560
No, it is not the same.

751
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,560
What others say and what I sign to is not the same.

752
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,560
Why?

753
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,560
Do you mean to deny this confession when you are free?

754
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,560
I mean to deny nothing.

755
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,560
Then explain to me Mr. Proctor while you will not let.

756
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,560
Proctor with a cry of his whole soul.

757
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Because it is my name.

758
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:03,560
Because I cannot have another in my life because I lie and sign myself to lies.

759
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,560
Because I am not worth the dust on the feet of them that hang.

760
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,560
How may I live without my name?

761
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,560
I have given you my soul.

762
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,560
Leave me my name.

763
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,560
Danforth pointing at the confession in Proctor's hand.

764
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,560
Is that document a lie?

765
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,560
If it is a lie, I will not accept it.

766
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,560
What say you?

767
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,560
I will not deal in lies, Mr.

768
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,560
Proctor is motionless.

769
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,560
You will give me your honest confession in my hand or I cannot keep you from the rope.

770
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
Proctor does not reply.

771
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,560
What way do you go, Mr.

772
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,560
Proctor?

773
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,560
He has breast heaving his eyes staring.

774
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,560
Proctor tears the paper and crumbles it.

775
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,560
And he is weeping in fury but erect.

776
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,560
Marshall, Paris hysterically as though the tearing paper were his life.

777
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,560
Proctor?

778
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,560
Proctor?

779
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,560
Man, you will hang.

780
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
You cannot.

781
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,560
Proctor is eyes full of tears.

782
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,560
I can.

783
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,560
And there's your first marvel that I can.

784
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:12,560
You have made your magic now, for now I do think I see some shred of goodness in John Proctor.

785
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,560
Not enough to weave a banner with but white enough to keep it from such dogs.

786
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,560
Elizabeth, in a burst of tear, rushes to him and weeps against his hand.

787
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,560
Give them note here.

788
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,560
Tears pleasure them.

789
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:31,560
Show honor now, show a stony heart and sink them with it.

790
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,560
He has lifted her and kisses her now with great passion.

791
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,560
Let you fear nothing.

792
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,560
Another judgment waits us all.

793
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,560
Hang them high over the town.

794
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,560
Who weeps for these weeps for corruption.

795
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,560
He sweeps out past them.

796
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,560
Heric starts to lead Rebecca, who almost collapses.

797
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,560
But Proctor catches her and she glances up at him, apologetically.

798
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,560
I've had no breakfast.

799
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,560
Go, man.

800
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
Heric escorts them out.

801
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,560
Atheran and she ver behind them.

802
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,560
Elizabeth stands staring at the empty doorway.

803
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,560
Paris, intently fear, do Elizabeth.

804
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,560
Go to him, go to him, go to him, go to him, go to him, go to him, go to him.

805
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,560
There is yet time.

806
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,560
From outside a drumroll strikes the air.

807
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
Paris is startled.

808
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,560
Elizabeth jerks about toward the window.

809
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,560
Go to him.

810
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,560
He rushes out the door as though to hold back his fate.

811
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,560
Proctor, Proctor!

812
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,560
Again, a short burst of trumps.

813
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,560
Woman pleads with him.

814
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,560
He starts to rush out the door and then goes back to her.

815
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,560
Woman, it is pride.

816
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,560
It is vanity.

817
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,560
She avoids his eyes and moves to the window.

818
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,560
He drops to his knees.

819
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,560
Be his helper.

820
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,560
What profit him to bleed?

821
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,560
Shall the dust praise him?

822
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,560
Shall the worms declare his truth?

823
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,560
Go to him, take his shame away.

824
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,560
Elizabeth, supporting herself against collapse, grips the bars of the window, and with a cry.

825
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,560
He have his goodness now.

826
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,560
God forbid I take it from him.

827
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,560
The final drumroll crashes, then heightens violently.

828
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:08,560
Hail weeps in front of prayer, and the new sun is pouring in upon her face.

829
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,560
And the drums rattle like bones in the morning air.

830
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,560
The curtain falls.
